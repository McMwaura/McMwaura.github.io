            Incase you havent met me before, here's the short version of who I am. Having an interest in learning to code, I joined <a class="moringa" href="https://moringaschool.com/">Moringa School</a> with the hopes of gaining skills and a knowledge for the art.
          </p>
          <p>
            I think of coding as an art, not just something you do. As a laid-back guy who is naturally curious about things, I embarked on my journey to learn code and although I'm still new to it, I have made it this far.
          </p>
          <p>
            In a nutshell, I'm a curious guy who likes sports, music, and poetry.

          <p><img src="images/theo.jpg" class="theo" alt="A picture of me">
            Incase you havent met me before, here's the short version of who I am. Having an interest in learning to code, I joined Moringa School with the hopes of gaining skills and a knowledge for the art.
          </p>
          <p>
            You see, I think of coding as an art, not just something you do. As a laid-back guy who is naturally curious about things, I embarked on my journey to learn code and although I'm still new to it, I have made it this far.
          </p>
          <p>
            In a nutshell, I'm a laid-back, curious guy who likes sports, music, and poetry.
